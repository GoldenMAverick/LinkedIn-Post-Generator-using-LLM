# LinkedIn Post Generator using LLM
A web-based application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate engaging and professional LinkedIn posts tailored to user input. The project integrates LangChain for prompt orchestration, Streamlit for an interactive front-end interface, and custom CSS styling for a polished user experience.

The system enables users to input a topic, tone, and desired post length, after which the LLM processes the request and produces a ready-to-use LinkedIn post. The architecture emphasizes modularity and scalability, making it easy to swap models or extend features such as hashtag generation, post scheduling, or sentiment adjustment.
